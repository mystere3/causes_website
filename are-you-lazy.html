					<h1>Lazy (adj.)</h1>
					<p><b>: unwilling to work or use energy.</b></p>
					<p><b>: not having much activity.</b></p>

					<p>Every now and then, we want to give a few moments to ourselves. After all, we deserve it, don't we? I mean, we have to work so hard in our day to day lives that it's only right that we get a little break time to recooperate before we go back to work more. After all, that Star Wars movie marathon won't watch itself. Oh wait, a marathon of Breaking Bad? And I also believe that a friend of yours just send you a link on your facebook to "The Top Ten Biggest Dog FAILS of ALL TIME", and MAN doesn't that seem exciting?! There are so many things to do you can't help but take some well deserved time away from your work to catch up on these things! Honestly though who needs to work anyway I'm actually getting really tired of typing this I might come back to it later I really have so much better things to do with my time then this actually where are my fritos anyway? </p>
					<p>So actually it's been a couple of weeks since I typed that last paragraph and I realized I completely forgot to talk about the idea of being lazy. You see, being lazy is actually incredibly convinent. You're always doing whatever you want, the only clock you're on is your own, and the only person you're out to impress is yourself. In a lot of ways, being lazy is like the ultimate form of self love! I mean, you love yourself, don't you? I mean why wouldn't y</p>
					<p>Actually it's been a couple more weeks since that last paragraph as well. Some people say being lazy is a bad thing. I for one find it completely convinient. But, the company wanted me to put out a list of potential "symptoms" of laziness (if you can really call them that, I prefer the term LIFEHACKS). In any case...</p>
					<p><b>POTENTIAL LAZINESS SYMPTIOMS INCLUDE</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Not leaving your couch</li>
						<li>Not leaving your house</li>
						<li>Hiring strangers on craigslist to go to the local redbox so you can rent the latest 30 Rock season.</li>
						<li>Buying a clap light on Amazon but not opening the door when the package comes because that's a really long walk</li>
					</ul>
					<p>So, yeah. If you have any one of these things, you're probably lazy. But is that such a bad thing?</p>
